This is a simple task management app built using React. It serves as a practical demonstration of fundamental React concepts such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`. The app allows you to create and delete tasks, with each task having a name and description.

## Features

- **Task Creation**: You can create tasks by providing a task name and description.
- **Task Deletion**: Tasks can be easily deleted with a single click.
- **Component Organization**: The app is structured into different components, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.
- **State Management**: React's `useState` hook is used for managing the state of tasks.
- **Side Effects**: The `useEffect` hook is employed to handle any necessary side effects, such as updating the UI when tasks are modified.
- **Context API**: The Context API is utilized for efficiently passing task-related data between components.
